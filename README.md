Hi, I’m a macOS security researcher focused on understanding system internals, kernel mechanisms, and Apple security subsystems.  
I explore and analyze mechanisms like AMFI, SIP/CSR, Mach, kernel memory protections, and I develop PoCs to study their behavior.

## 🔹 About Me
- Passionate about low-level macOS security and reverse engineering  
- Deep understanding of kernel, sandbox, and system integrity mechanisms  
- Focused on AppleMobileFileIntegrity (AMFI), CSR/SIP, and Mach kernel interfaces  
- Research style: practical experimentation + analytical reasoning  
- Future goal: contribute to security research, exploit development, and responsible disclosure

---

## 🛠️ Research Areas
- AMFI & CSR/SIP: exploring Apple’s code signing, integrity policies, and boot-time protections  
- Kernel Internals: memory management, Mach ports, task_for_pid, system calls  
- Sandbox & Security Mechanisms: bypass techniques and PoC creation  
- Exploit Development: building safe proof-of-concepts to study system behavior  

---

## 📂 Tools & Skills
- Languages: C, C++, Swift, Assembly (x86/ARM/ARM64e), JavaScript for V8  
- Reverse Engineering: LLDB, Hopper, IDA, Ghidra  
- macOS internals: Mach, XNU kernel, AMFI, CSR/SIP, NVRAM  
- Networking & Security: IOKit, system calls, sandbox analysis  

---

## 🔹 Selected Projects / Experiments
- csr_info – custom utility to read and check CSR/SIP flags  
- PoCs demonstrating AMFI behavior and system call interactions  
- Research notes on task_for_pid, sandbox escape, and kernel object management  
- Experiments with low-level memory primitives, Mach ports, and kernel debugging  

---

## 📈 Goals
- Build a complete understanding of macOS security mechanisms  
- Document findings in PoCs and educational notes  
- Gradually expand into broader Apple ecosystem security research  

---

## ⚡ Fun Fact
- I work clean and focused, without relying on alcohol or shortcuts  
- Strong believer in understanding systems deeply before attempting exploits
